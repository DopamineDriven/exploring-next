Now serverless is emerging as an even smaller component of the new way of building applications piece by piece.  In our zeal to adopt the latest in architectural approaches, have we given sufficient thought to where they are going or what comes next?\n<br/><br/>\nIf you are considering building an application with a microservice or serverless based architecture, come to this panel of experienced cloud developers and architects and learn what these technologies can do for you now, and what they will do in the future.  Ask our panel questions on what works, what doesn't, and how to prepare today for the technology that's coming next.",

You keep going down the rabbit hole and don’t know how to make that ride comfortable. This no-slide and code-only session will explain how a Java application consisting of different microservices can be deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. Specifically, it will explain the following:\n\nShow a Java application with three microservices\nHow this application is packaged as a Docker image\nCreate Kubernetes manifests\nHow Helm charts are created and hosted in a Helm repository\nTest in a local environment\nAttach debugger\nInstall Istio in k8s, show service visibility\nInstall k8s on AWS\nMigrate application from a local cluster to a cluster on the Cloud\nSetup deployment pipeline using CodePipeline\nUse an Alexa skill to scale the application\nChange application, show A/B using Istio",

Using messages as the communication mechanism among different services allows more independence of the individual components that make up a larger system, thus enabling faster development, faster deployment, and additional scalability.  Introducing Persistent Messages further enhances the architecture to allow time independence as well.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the overall structure of an Event Driven Architecture, discuss the business and technical advantages, and review how to migrate an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture.  Brad will present his experiences in migrating an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture, talk about lessons learned along the way.\n\nIf you have a large legacy application you need to break into microservices, or you are involved in a Domain Driven Design project, this talk is for you.\n",

          "description": "Agile is based on self-organizing teams, so if teams organize themselves, what do managers do?\n<br/><br/>\nIt turns out that managers can play a critical role both in agile adoption and in agile success long-term.\n<br/><br/>\nUnfortunately, scrum training mostly doesn’t address the role: when trainers and coaches sketch the structure of a scrum team, they almost never include a manager. \n<br/>\nManagers not knowing their changed role can be a problem: A frequently cited barrier to agile adoption is managers who don't know what to do when their teams become self-managing. When they're not included in training, how would they (or anyone else, for that matter) know the contributions to which managers need to apply themselves. Worse, their larger organizations often lay down expectations for them that are incompatible with agile. \n<br/><br/>\nAgile has shifted the old roles and responsibilities. A manager bent on command-and-control is clearly a barrier to agile adoption. But managers who take a hands-off approach or are unclear on the contribution they must make will almost certainly stymie adoption, as well.\n<br/><br/>\nRon Lichty echoes many of the early agile thought leaders: managers have critical roles to play in enabling success, both in transitioning to agile and in agile itself. \n<br/><br/>This session is about managers’ critical contributions, and is for managers, for prospective managers, for team leads, and for members of teams thinking through how to make their teams the best teams they’ve ever been part of.",

What’s right for your company? And how do you help candidates do their very best (and why is this so important)? How to keep your standards reasonable, but high and consistent? How do you limit your false negatives and false positives? \n<br/><br/>\nHiring managers and recruiters will learn how to create a better process. Interviewers will learn how to select and ask better questions. And candidates will get to explore what happens on the other side of the hiring table. \n<br/><br/>\nThis session will cover behavioral questions, coding questions, algorithm questions, knowledge questions, design questions, and code assessment/test tools.",

While running one Redis in one container is limiting, it can be very useful. But deploying Redis in a cluster of containers can give you scale and reliability your startup needs. In fact, some companies run 100's of instances of Redis as their primary database. In this talk, I'll share 5 popular use cases for Redis in Containers, Kubernetes and even Serverless. And I'll show you how to package Redis for deployment via Docker & Kubernetes. If I'm feeling gutsy, I might even show you how to run Redis on Windows.",

Each service has its own private database that’s only accessible indirectly through the services API. Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas.

Eventually, the application will become extremely large and the organization ends up in monolithic hell. All aspects of development, testing and deployment are slow and painful. It’s impossible for the developers to keep up with the demands of the business. And, to make matters worse the application uses a technology stack that is increasingly obsolete.\n\nThe way to escape monolithic hell is to migrate to the microservice architecture. In this talk, you will learn about the essential characteristics of microservices. I describe the benefits and drawbacks  of the microservice architecture and when it makes sense to use it. You will learn about the design problems you will encounter when using microservices. I describe how to solve this problems by applying the microservices pattern language. You will learn how the microservice architecture accelerates the delivery of large, complex applications.\n",

We will differentiate between machine learning and the sub-field of deep learning, and pursue a more intuitive understanding of how deep learning is implemented. Primarily, we will explore neural networks and their most common architectures, focusing on the deep neural networks that are most effectively used with visual data such as image recognition (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks), and those most amenable to sequential data like natural language processing (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks). The aim is for attendees to become conversant with deep learning and to acquire a clearer understanding of the concept as well as its application.",

The primary focus of his consulting practice has mirrored what he did as a manager: untangling the knots in software development. As <a href=\"http://www.ronlichty.com\"target=_blank>Ron Lichty Consulting</a>, he takes on fractional Interim VP Engineering and Acting CTO roles, trains teams in scrum, transitions teams to agile, trains managers in managing software people and teams, and advises organizations and coaches teams to make their software development “hum.” His 450-page book, <a href=\"http://www.ManagingTheUnmanageable.net\"target=_blank><I>Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams</I></a>, was recently released as video training - <a href=\" http://www.ManagingTheUnmanageable.net/video.html\"target=_blank><I>LiveLessons: Managing Software People and Teams</I></a> - both from Pearson and on O’Reilly’s Safari Network. He also co-authors the biannual <a href=\" http://www.ronlichty.com/study.html\"target=_blank><I>Study of Product Team Performance</I></a>.</p>",

Using messages as the communication mechanism among different services allows more independence of the individual components that make up a larger system, thus enabling faster development, faster deployment, and additional scalability.  Introducing Persistent Messages further enhances the architecture to allow time independence as well.\n\nIn this talk we will look at the overall structure of an Event Driven Architecture, discuss the business and technical advantages, and review how to migrate an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture.  Brad will present his experiences in migrating an existing application to an Event Driven Architecture, talk about lessons learned along the way.\n\nIf you have a large legacy application you need to break into microservices, or you are involved in a Domain Driven Design project, this talk is for you.\n",

      "description": "Agile is based on self-organizing teams, so if teams organize themselves, what do managers do?\n<br/><br/>\nIt turns out that managers can play a critical role both in agile adoption and in agile success long-term.\n<br/><br/>\nUnfortunately, scrum training mostly doesn’t address the role: when trainers and coaches sketch the structure of a scrum team, they almost never include a manager. \n<br/>\nManagers not knowing their changed role can be a problem: A frequently cited barrier to agile adoption is managers who don't know what to do when their teams become self-managing. When they're not included in training, how would they (or anyone else, for that matter) know the contributions to which managers need to apply themselves. Worse, their larger organizations often lay down expectations for them that are incompatible with agile. \n<br/><br/>\nAgile has shifted the old roles and responsibilities. A manager bent on command-and-control is clearly a barrier to agile adoption. But managers who take a hands-off approach or are unclear on the contribution they must make will almost certainly stymie adoption, as well.\n<br/><br/>\nRon Lichty echoes many of the early agile thought leaders: managers have critical roles to play in enabling success, both in transitioning to agile and in agile itself. \n<br/><br/>This session is about managers’ critical contributions, and is for managers, for prospective managers, for team leads, and for members of teams thinking through how to make their teams the best teams they’ve ever been part of.",

          "userBio": "<p>Ron Lichty has been managing and, more recently, consulting in managing software development and product organizations for over 25 years. Before that, as a programmer, he coded compiler code generators, was awarded patents for compression and security algorithms he designed and coded for embedded microcontroller devices, wrote two widely used programming texts, and developed the computer animation demo that Apple used to launch and sell a next-generation line of PCs. The primary focus of his consulting practice has mirrored what he did as a manager: untangling the knots in software development. As <a href=\"http://www.ronlichty.com\"target=_blank>Ron Lichty Consulting</a>, he takes on fractional Interim VP Engineering and Acting CTO roles, trains teams in scrum, transitions teams to agile, trains managers in managing software people and teams, and advises organizations and coaches teams to make their software development “hum.” His 450-page book, <a href=\"http://www.ManagingTheUnmanageable.net\"target=_blank><I>Managing the Unmanageable: Rules, Tools, and Insights for Managing Software People and Teams</I></a>, was recently released as video training - <a href=\" http://www.ManagingTheUnmanageable.net/video.html\"target=_blank><I>LiveLessons: Managing Software People and Teams</I></a> - both from Pearson and on O’Reilly’s Safari Network. He also co-authors the biannual <a href=\" http://www.ronlichty.com/study.html\"target=_blank><I>Study of Product Team Performance</I></a>.</p>",

When they're not included in training, how would they (or anyone else, for that matter) know the contributions to which managers need to apply themselves. Worse, their larger organizations often lay down expectations for them that are incompatible with agile. \n<br/><br/>\nAgile has shifted the old roles and responsibilities. A manager bent on command-and-control is clearly a barrier to agile adoption. But managers who take a hands-off approach or are unclear on the contribution they must make will almost certainly stymie adoption, as well.\n<br/><br/>\nRon Lichty echoes many of the early agile thought leaders: managers have critical roles to play in enabling success, both in transitioning to agile and in agile itself. \n<br/><br/>This session is about managers’ critical contributions, and is for managers, for prospective managers, for team leads, and for members of teams thinking through how to make their teams the best teams they’ve ever been part of.",

Each service has its own private database that’s only accessible indirectly through the services API. Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas. I describe the key role that messaging plays a microservice architecture.",

Consequently, implementing queries and transactions that span multiple services is challenging. In this presentation, you will learn how to solve these distributed data management challenges using asynchronous messaging. I describe how to implement transactions using sagas, which are sequences of local transactions, coordinated using messages. You will learn how to implement queries using Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), which uses events to maintain replicas. I describe the key role that messaging plays a microservice architecture.",
